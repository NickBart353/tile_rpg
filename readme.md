# Tile Explorer

This was my first attempt at making an open world game, in which you can walk around and explore several "maps". Controls are WASD to move around. 

I have encountered several problems, such as trying to display the world as a grid, moving while holding down the movement keys, a "camera" that follows the player while moving and swapping maps when entering the exit fields. I couldn't be bothered to finish the last two maps, so they will just stay as an empty grass and dirt field. 

This was also the first time making my own art assets. Initially I used paint for the background but when I wanted to add animations i swapped to aseprite.

Overall I am happy with the product and it was a fun experience.
